       "'Just to draw an important distinction... During that same time period, hospital revenue was down over 75% in some places. I haven\\'t personally heard of any closures, but many hospitals had to furlough and/or let people go.  \\n\\nAnd just to put a pin in the topic... Look how your car insurance gave you 10-15% back because nobody was driving. This was risk adjustments. Now where the FUCK is that from health insurance?  \\n\\nI\\'ll just keep saying this over and over until the end of time: health insurance companies are blood sucking middlemen and the entire problem with healthcare cost and delivery in this country. Meanwhile they are cutting doctor reimbursement and hospital reimbursement, while patients still have to pay their premiums. Insurance companies have done such a tremendous job on conditioning patients to think that they have their best interest in mind and conditioning doctors to think that they will have a better career with insurance in the game. As a dentist, I\\'m told every day that I cannot do treatment for a patient because someone without a dental degree working for the insurance company is dictating the patients treatment based on whether or not the insurance company will make or lose money. It\\'s absolutely mind boggling how doctors have not unionized and taken back control of healthcare.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSome of you guys may say, \"Well dentists and doctors are just greedy\". Well go ahead and look at the increase in income for dentists and doctors over the last 20 years. The average income is actually going DOWN, while the debt load and cost of training is rising due to tuition. This makes becoming a doctor less attractive for society. In contrast, look at the stock of UHC in the last 20 years. Over a 4,000% fucking increase! The CEO of Cigna gets paid over $43 million fucking dollars in direct compensation. Fuck for profit insurance companies. They have no place in healthcare. \"People were avoiding the doctor’s office and delaying elective surgeries such as knee replacement. Those with mild symptoms of Covid-19 were initially advised to stay home unless they needed urgent care.\"\\n\\nSome hospitals were full of covid patients. Most weren\\'t, and many hospitals are facing layoffs due to a lack of patients. \\n\\nPaying for individual services is ultimately a flawed model for healthcare, and this is just one more example. Everyone knows the health care industry is fucking terrible over here for those who cannot afford it. Unfortunately very few of our politicians will ever do anything to combat the health insurance Mafia and our two presidential candidates can attest to that. The system is backwards and inhumane Holy cow. A lot of the big car insurance companies have been issuing refunds or discounts because people aren’t driving as much. A lot of that money could’ve been kept as profit. I’m sure keeping ahead of state regulators was part of the decision, but either way I don’t see why heath insurers aren’t held to the same standard. You know, beyond them being more akin to extortionists than insurers. After a short period of uncertainty, it became clear that the cost of providing medical care would be lower in 2020. People were avoiding the doctor’s office and delaying elective surgeries such as knee replacement. Those with mild symptoms of Covid-19 were initially advised to stay home unless they needed urgent care.\\n\\nBut the money insurance companies collect each month from individuals, known as premiums, kept pouring in. “Private insurance companies make money by taking in premiums and not paying for care,” Woolhandler said. Of fucking course they did. Everyone\\'s still paying health insurance but really aren\\'t going to the doctor for things like routine physicals. Killing hospitals but the insurance companies are basically printing money Healthcare should not be a for profit business period The USA is a broken state. It is a corporation, nothing more I\\'m not surprised.  Its the perfect scenario for insurance companies. Everyone\\'s afraid of being sick and no one wants to get treatment for anything unless they are about to drop dead. If you are enraged by this, what are you going to do about it? Rage commenting on Reddit solves NOTHING. Writing a clever quip about crony-capitalism, neoliberal bloodsuckery, or the sheer moral bankruptcy of our institutions and patting yourself on the back for your contribution to the rage thread solves NOTHING.

They benefit from people’s suffering, which is about as evil a conflict of interest could be. EMT here. Our hospital furloughed a bunch of people at first. We are reorganizing as it\\'s a new fiscal year (July). \\n\\nI had a unique experience with two hospital visits this year. I went on vacation, went to bed and woke up in the ER of another hospital. I had a tonic clonic status seizure in my sleep. I dislocated both of my arms at some point. The hospital was out of network and couldn\\'t find my card. I ended up being discharged after five hours and woke up at my moms house two days later with both of my arms still out and I couldn\\'t stop barfing. \\n\\nI went to my hospital. I was admitted for the arms, traumatic rhabdomyolysis, (Ck of 30,000) and undiagnosed epilepsy....\\n\\nI stayed five days and was back at work in five weeks. But, shit, I am so pissed off at the first hospital. I sent joint commission after them and demanded to speak to their board... I am assuming all because they didn\\'t want to be out of pocket... This is what insurers dream of. People paying for medical  insurance then not being able to use it. Jokes on them...I don\\'t have insurance. Still fightn for that M4A tho. But not likely under biden/harris If we\\'d stop treating healthcare as a commodity to be profited from, we could actually get everyone decent care. The insurers are the largest inefficiency in the US healthcare system.  They take too much and give a small percentage back.  They have the real death panels where their quackery decide what drugs and procedures you get.  They decide based on cost only ignoring the benefits to the people they injure with their ignorant policies. Hurry up and get Universal Healthcare, America. I’m sure Biden will get right on that. (Looks at his donor list).\\n\\nAnd no, Trump wasn’t going to fix it either. This was exactly what Bernie was talking about when these comapnies were making immense amounts of profit. But still Biden got nominated who will continue to let these companies make immense amounts of profit. Profits are up because claims are down. As awful as the American healthcare system is, this isn’t some ploy by the insurance companies. \\n\\nAuto insurance companies were able to provide discounted premium because fewer people driving means less risk (and fewer payouts). Health insurance premiums haven’t gone down so instead the bottom line gets padded Misleading headline, profits are up due primarily to elective surgeries and any nonessential doctor visits being canceled. Meanwhile premiums are still being paid. Additionally a fixed percentage of premiums (80-85%) must go toward care, so those profits will drop as rebate checks eventually go out to consumers.\\n\\nThe real story is the effect the pandemic is having on medical practices and hospital staff. The death panels stand triumphant. They have ruthlessly crushed a political insurgency that directly threatened their interests. Theres a pandemic on that overworks the hospitals to such a degree that it forces many sick people to stay home; moreover the disease most significantly threatens a demographic most likely to be covered by Medicare at taxpayer expense. They have an administration showering them with \"small business\" money. Theyre one of the few industries totally immune to the economic catastrophe caused by the pandemic. And now they\\'re making record profits!\\n\\nTruly a golden era! Profiting off the misery of others is the most American thing in the world! This is what we need to be protesting. To get rid of health insurers and big pharma. Yeah, because everyone had to pay they\\'re premium but no one used the services.  Duh. *we will repeal and replace. repeal, and, replace, the obamacare disaster. in its place you will have a big beautiful healthcare plan. it will be tremendous. it will be affordable.* Meanwhile every hospital in CT had mass layoffs. This thread is full of nonsense. The issue is simple.  The government prohibited having non-emergency medical procedures. Thus no costs. Thus no insurance payments. Thus insurance profits rise. Thw law says they have to rebate the excess back to the insured so this hysteria is basically propaganda. They will also be raising rates by alot in 2021. Surprised there is little mention of this. They\\'ll never catch me alive! I just pay out of pocket for medicines and health care that isn\\'t health insurance, and get taxed at the end of the year for not having health insurance. It\\'s still thousands less than having health insurance that I couldn\\'t afford to use. This is really fake news designed on outrage. It fails even basic fact checking. https://ir.antheminc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/anthem-reports-second-quarter-results-reaffirms-commitment?field_nir_news_date_value[min]=\\n\\nYes the profits are temporarily higher. Why is that? They saw a surge in subscribers at the start of 2020 due to the return of the punitive healthcare tax. COVID-19 hit and people spent less than the past year (by only 4%). Their tax burden was also delayed by the CARES act. End of story.\\n\\nSo total revenue is up 15%, total cost is up only 8%. That\\'s all it takes to \"double profits\". For-profit healthcare will go down in history as a symbol of human greed and selfishness. Allowing large portions of your population to choose to suffer for financial reasons is avoidable and very wrong. Avoidable and very wrong should be America’s slogan. Duh. Everyone deferred their knee surgeries, so the insurance company didn\\'t pay claims. That\\'s gonna catch up to them when people are comfortable going back. And get worse, considering people are deferring their preventive care, too. That could spell big health problems that a routine checkup could have caught. That\\'s bad for people\\'s health and expensive for insurance companies :( Insurers aren\\'t on the hook for COVID related charges, and nobody was getting elective surgeries. Insurers made bank, hospitals went bankrupt. Yeah....health insurers didn\\'t have to pay out as much because\\n\\n1) fewer people leaving their homes leads to fewer accidents and injuries\\n\\n2) fewer people leaving their homes for treatment for pre-existing conditions and postponing surgeries\\n\\n3) fewer people leaving their homes for routine checkups, bloodwork, scans, standard procedures\\n\\n4) everyone is getting psychiatric telehealth due to stress and depression from losing jobs money and friends and family, and insurers are like \"lol sorry mental health comes out of pocket because it\\'s not real healthcare\" We havent spent ten thousand years learning to cure and heal for the benefit of the administration industry.  Every one of those 6.7B dollars siphoned off to insurance profit is a cure and heal dollar wasted. Profiting off of the sick, suffering and dying. Bernie has the closest to a good answer, but we cannot vote for him. There are plenty of good examples how medical should be done in other countries, but neither party wants to lose the funding. Copying what I wrote about this in r/economics. \\n\\n“As someone who studies economics and has worked in healthcare doing research on the healthcare market, this article is only telling half the story.\\n\\nInsurers, aka payers in healthcare lingo, have massive profits this quarter because most people are delaying elective procedures. Eventually people will return and get those elective procedures done plus any additional procedures needed because of the delay and when they start returning, it’s expected to be a lot at once.\\n\\nThis means that while Q2 profits might be high, pretty much everyone I know in healthcare expects Q3 or Q4 profits to tank because of people returning to the hospital.” Because all non-vital procedures were put on hold, everybody\\'s been too scared to step foot in a doctor\\'s office or medical clinic unless it\\'s for Covid-like symptoms, and yet your premiums remain the same. This news would sicken me if I could afford to be sick. Why do these companies exist?  No reason at all except to screw people out of medical care and pile up money.  Rip them apart and burn the scraps. I have honestly been contemplating getting rid of my health insurance and just opening an HSA for the smaller things.  I have avoided the doctor my entire work career because I cannot afford the 4K deductible either so really I have just lost that premium money. I know the idea of insurance is to help with IF something big happens but even after meeting my deductible of 4K something big costing let\\'s say 50k only covered at 80% still puts me in the whole 14k which I cannot afford between my student loans, continuing to pay the insurance and the payment play that I would have to create for that. I would end up declaring bankruptcy either way 14k or 50k Genuine question, and not trying to get downvoted...but is there anyway to strike/boycott these insurance companies? I know the only way to enact change these days is to hurt companies’ wallets..\\n\\nEdit: Grammar Health care system in this country is not going to get any better, too many people making $$$ off the present mess I\\'ve been railing against this shit for so long but no one seems to give a fuck and everyone rushes to put money in their pockets.  I\\'m sick of it, might as well buy stock and tell all of these dumb fucks voting against their own interests to, \"fuck you, pay me.\" If mostly older people are hospitalized by COVID, I’ll bet many of the patients are on Medicare. Private insurance companies likely have felt little pain from COVID. Combine that with less doctor visits and elective surgeries postponed/canceled and they are probably in great shape. \\n\\nSame for auto insurance. Nobody on the roads but everyone is still their paying premiums. I’d imagine companies like AAA are in great shape too with few of their customers using any of their services. I canceled AAA years ago when I found out I get many of the same services included with my car insurance. Let\\'s not forget what insurance companies actually are. They\\'re for profit investment firms. They take your premiums, invest the money, and attempt to pay out as little as possible in order to make a profit.\\n\\nThese companies have ZERO incentive to try to make your care better, cheaper, or easier.\\n\\nEdit: because it\\'s not even 9am and I\\'m all fired up already, if anyone ever wonders about this... Take a look at every \"change\" the insurance industry has pushed and see how it negatively impacts patients...\\n\\n-adding new drug formulary tiers to plans, causing patients to pay more in drug co-pays and making branded drugs less available. \\n\\n-adding more prior authorizations or step edits to drugs they may have to pay slightly more for. Have a drug that will knock out a disease in two weeks but it\\'ll cost them $75... Nope, first you have to use a cheaper chronic daily generic and even if you get slightly better they won\\'t cover the two week drug because \"you showed improvement\" on the one they don\\'t pay as much for. \\n\\n-offering employers high deductible plans for the employees. Employers take them because they are cheaper (for the company, not for you). Insurers know most patients with high deductible plans will put off care because of the massive out of pocket costs. Except there are boatloads of studies that show this leads to WORSE outcomes for patients (who miss important diseases because they\\'re putting off care). But why should insurers give a shit, they\\'re just banking premiums and paying less out. aah yes the land of the free Well, as long as they got theirs. We found the leech on the American Medical system. Oh I believe it.\\n\\nI called my son’s pediatrician to report he had a fever, dry cough, headache and needed a Covid test.  The doctor said “we don’t have any tests.  Just monitor him and if he gets worse call me.”\\n\\nThree weeks later I get a call “Your son’s insurance information needs to be updated” and I ask “why?  We haven’t seen the doctor in over a year”... “oh because I have that you called us a few weeks ago, and the rules say we can bill insurance for that.”\\n\\nI said “you’re going to send a bill because I called you and you said ‘we can’t help you’????”\\n\\nAfter a pause she said “..maybe I’ll just write this one off.”\\n\\nGood grief. Devils advocate here. It’s not that health insurance *won’t* give any money back, it’s that they *haven’t yet*. I work for a national health insurance company and we have plenty of plans for premium forgiveness and other ways to give premium back.\\n\\nAnd you don’t even need to trust our good will. If our MLR (a calculation for how much money we spent on healthcare costs) is below 80% to 85%, we have to pay back rebates to reach that amount (for ACA plans only though).\\n\\nWe are on a different time schedule than most P&C companies like car insurance. They generally sell on a 6 month basis and we sell 12 month. Plus we have a ton more regulations. All this means we are slower to pay you back.\\n\\nOf course non of this applies if your company does something different like a self funded product, but if that’s what you have then we don’t even really charge you your premiums then. I work for a health insurance company, the largest provider in our state (65%+ of the population), and we have been flooding money out the door.\\n\\nBack in April we announced to all our members that anything COVID-related would be covered, no questions asked. You need to get tested? Covered. You tested positive and have to be in the hospital? Covered. Family member self-quarantined and you need medication delivered? Covered.\\n\\nAnd for our employees, we sent 96% of them home the second week of April and they are still there. On top of that, there is a charge line for COVID-19 in our timesheet software that people can charge time to if they were unable to work due to the pandemic. And it doesn\\'t have to be just for them, if they have a sick family member they have to take care of they can charge to that instead of taking PTO as well. There are some people who have worked 0 hours in the last 2-4 months that still get a paycheck, benefits, and haven\\'t been let go.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak to the health insurance companies listed in the article, but the one I work for has not been profiting. Any extra money we have has gone right back out the door.\\n\\nFor all you schmucks out there who just hate health insurance companies because you think they all act the same, stop being an idiot. There are a lot out there who actually do care and are willing to take a hit when it\\'s in the best interest of their members.\\n\\nFor a little extra salt: last year our company spent 94% of our intake on insurance claims, and 6% on operating costs, and we only had ~2mil left over at the end of the year. Our goal is to get that operating cost down to 4% with +/- <1mil in error. And when you\\'re managing close to a billion dollars a year and only have 2mil leftover (that got put in to the IT upgrade fund for this year) there is very little room for error. We aren\\'t out here making bank and stealing people\\'s money.\\n\\nIf you want someone to blame, look to big pharma and how much money is charged for a simple overnight hospital stay. Then you\\'ll find where all the money goes. I love that I’m considered a “healthcare hero” but all I’ve received is a few free sandwiches, furlough days, and have have to use my vacation days instead of getting workman’s comp if I test positive for covid because “we don’t know where you got it”. It’s time for a goddamn revolution That’s what happens when no one is actually going to the hospital :) US Health insurers are bound by the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) provisions in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\\n\\nUnder these regulations they are required to spend .85c of every $1.00 they receive in premium payments on paying for medical services for their plan members.\\n\\nThis leaves .15c of premium revenue for all operating costs and profit.  Most plan\\'s operating costs run between 10-13%.\\n\\nDoubling profit as a raw number is one thing, but their margins remain relatively stable.  The only way for them to increase their margins is to decrease their administrative costs.\\n\\n(They are also required to share back to all plan members any premium revenue less than .85 of every $1.00 spent.  E.g.  If a plan only spends .80c of every premium dollar on services for a given year, they split the .05c margin of revenue between all the plan members and send them a check.\\n\\nMy family has received a ~$1,500-3,000 reimbursement each year since this regulation went into effect, from Optima.)\\n\\nThey are essentially profit capped.  This article is kind of misleading. Isn\\'t it crazy how we are supposed to care more about how other countries treat their citizens and minorities, when we are just as bad in many ways if not worse People stayed away from the healthcare system if at all possible for the first half of 2020. Premiums stayed the same. It’s just math. Rebates is one way they can send money back to the insured. I’m no fan of insurance companies but this seems like a natural consequence of unique circumstances Health insurance executives were the only major executives opposing Obama\\'s original plan; what America has now is the only thing that was going to be passed by the Republican party.\\n\\nWhat was passed and what we have wouldn\\'t have been the worst idea, considering that progress generally happens in stages ... but the country is damned ready for that next stage of progress.\\n\\nOf course the Republicans will ask if you think a company doesn\\'t deserve unlimited profits -- even if that comes of price gouging, destruction of the economy, and ultimately results in millions of Americans losing their personal rights, and is the direct cause of hundreds of thousands dying or suffering aside from covid 19. A corporation has the right to steal your money for their executives\\' personal gain. To them the government is bad for collecting funds to pay for everybody\\'s education and welfare, or even for the infrastructure upon which all business rides. You will never convince them otherwise. Fuckwit country. Americans don’t give a shit at all about their fellow man. Fucking filth. Yup. The most important thing.... the bottom line. Your life be damned. We need to abolish health insurance i fucking hate it here There is a LOT of misinformation in this thread.\\n\\nPreface: I despise the current US health care model, and in no way want to be seen as a defender of it.\\n\\nBut, if the insurance companies make too much money, they\\'ll have to pay back the extra anyway. One of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act was mandatory minimums on their Medical Loss Ratio. In other words the ratio of their income that must go to paying claims. For individual and small group plans, it\\'s 80%. For large group sales, it\\'s 85%.\\n\\nIf they aren\\'t paying out claims, and their ratio drops below these, they are legally bound to issue rebates.\\n\\nHowever, the process for doing so is also heavily regulated. I believe it is accessed annually (although I don\\'t remember if it\\'s the same date for all plans or based on what quarter the plan started or something). Point is, they can\\'t just issue rebates whenever they want or it\\'ll screw up their rate reviews with the government.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, they won\\'t get to make gobs of money off of this. Not for long. \\n\\nAlthough if you really want to get into \"how the sausage is made\", they\\'ll profit it in other ways. Insurance companies have to keep a regulated amount of \"cash on hand\" to pay out claims. Much like a bank cannot lend out 100% of their money at once. In the meantime they can invest those funds and earn profits from those investments. IIRC, those profits are not part of the MLR calculations, so they will make money from the excess income, then pay back the rebates later as needed. I work for a nonprofit insurance company in Wisconsin. Couple reasons we’re turning a profit -\\n\\n* Many providers stopped providing elective surgeries and treatments during the pandemic. Many have restarted, but these are cash cows for hospitals and major costs for insurance companies. \\n\\n* People, overall, are going out less. Telehealth appointments are becoming far more common and  a lot of hospitals charge a flat price for these - $20-40 per appointment compared to a traditional visit, which costs more. \\n\\n* Fewer people are reaching out for care. Part of it is fear of getting sick but also fear of cost. Layoffs have also had an impact as many are seeing cut and reduced coverage. \\n\\n* And finally, fewer people are hitting their deductibles. Usually, the profit margins begin to slide the closer you get to the end of the year - and this is important, because if this fall is as bad as they say it could be, those profits the media is telling you to get upset about may be what guarantees payment and coverage if you or a family member ends up in the ICU on a ventilator. I won’t justify a $6000 deductible for an individual - that is horseshit. But that is still better than the full, $20k bill. \\n\\nAnd because my company is nonprofit, we are mailing out premium rebates and our employee premiums were covered for a couple months. I’m just hoping we didn’t overspend now because this area is poor and people are fucking stupid, spreading shit like, “BIlL gAtEs iS gOiNG To mIcrOChIp uS WitH tHE vACcInE!” all while making $12 an hour, doing repetitive tasks in a factory, day after day. \\n\\nYeah... that makes you more qualified than an actual doctor or virologist who has spent years in their field. Well surely they will be lowering prices and passing the savings on to the customers While the guy who is supposedly better than the asshole we have now has said over and over that he and his new glorious VP candidate will not support anything but health insurance while we are in the worst recession in US history and more than one in four are unemployed. \\n\\nWhat a joke. Due to atrocities like this, I will fight capitalism until my dying breath.  To live a healthy life is a human right. We all deserve it. What?\\n\\nDon\\'t health insurers lose money when lots of people are using medical services? You guys get gouged so crazy in the US on this, AND healthcare. \\nInsurance works when the system around it works. The US health insurance industry needs to be challenged and reformed. Otherwise your life is worth shit. American Exceptionalism. A nation so deep in Stockholm Syndrome that you gotta be asleep to believe in the Dream. Burn them to the fucking ground and salt the earth. Fuck them, fuck their useless employees who didn\\'t develop more useful skillsets and decided to make a living being complicit to a predatory system, fuck the politicians that enabled them and accepted their lobby/bribe money, and fuck us all for not voting for people to tear down the entire system Profiting off of people\\'s suffering... hmmm where have I seen this before\\n\\n\\n*Dick Cheney has entered the chat* When you introduce a profit into any system, profit becomes the only motive. Crazy how any news from the U.S now just makes me say \"Well duh\" Good thing... I was starting to have real concerns for the well-being of the share holders! So 30ish million are out of work, millions infected, hundreds of thousands dying, \\nand hospitals are struggling....yet health insurers are raking it in.\\n\\nThere is obviously a problem here. US health insurance is a scam. ofcourse because no one could get an appointment or everything was cancelled I\\'ve been playing soccer for about a decade and never had a bad injury.\\n\\nThen I got kicked in the head, started bleeding out, and required almost 30 stitches inside and out.\\n\\nWe had to fight the insurance company tooth and nail to pay because they said getting kicked in the head and requiring stitches was a part of the game. \\n\\nThat being said, I also had to go to the hospital recently and worker\\'s comp covered everything. So that was nice. The health insurance companies make more money when people don\\'t file claims. With COVID19 hitting people didn\\'t frequently visit doctors unless they were actually sick. Then you also had optional procedures and surgeries put on hold. \\n\\nSo yeah, people & businesses were still paying for their health insurance but most weren\\'t tapping into it unless they had to. This means the health insurance companies collected money for their services and didn\\'t have to spend more on claims. I don\\'t understand why this is a bad thing. O wait, because its the Guardian and they are trying to create political drama. Can someone explain to me why the US doesn\\'t socialize their medical system? It already spends 17% (~$11,172 per person) of its GDP, yet it\\'s citizens get nothing?! \\n\\nHow the hell do people accept this?\\n\\nOther countries spend far less and give their citizens far more (Germany, Sweden, UK, Japan, Canada, Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Australia,  all spend less per person) Can we please get rid of them now... They should be giving some portion of premiums back to consumers like car insurance companies have done. The Republicans and Democrats (also their owners) do not want us to have universal healthcare like we fucking should because they use it as a form of control. We are all too busy trying to survive to focus too much on politics. If we had universal healthcare we could actually get real change done in this control for once. Also universal healthcare would have a huge tsunami effect across every facet of life and business to the best degree. The average person is so willfully ignorant that they think a slight increase to their taxes to achieve universal healthcare would cost them more. When in fact you would only save tons more of your own money. \\nThis year has put the Democrats and Republicans on full display on how despicable corrupt they are. My whole generation is fucked because of the cares act (and cowards like Bernie and other \"progressives\" voting for it). Things are about to get a hell of a lot worse in America. This country is and has been an oligarchy for decades now. Just because we can cast a vote doesn\\'t mean we are a democracy. We as the citizens are gonna have to force every public representative to give us what we want. It is literally they job after all. Government healthcare isn\\'t a perfect system but it prevents this. As a Canadian I never have to worry about being bankrupted or financially exploited by a medical situation. Whether, you are wealthy or poor, employed or jobless, getting help when you are sick should never be a financial decision. And if I can afford to get faster or upgraded care I have the choice to go private. The US system terrifies me. They make more money from causing health issues and jacking up the price of treatments than actually healing people. \"It\\'s a big club, and you ain\\'t in it\".\\n\\nGeorge Carlin This probably explains the Senate taking a vacation while the nation dies of the plague. Health Insurer\\'s profits doubled: I\\'ve been in the Health Insurance business, as a licensed agent, working for some of the biggest companies in the world, so I\\'m guessing alot of that profit is simply coming from the down sizing of infrastructure, there are 1.2 million licensed agents in the U.S. There are hundreds of thousands of agents working the Health markets, imagine the cost of office space, \\n equipment, liability insurance on the office, electricity, gazillions of Kwh\\'s, replacement equipment, and on and on, now try to imagine the cost of that massive infrastructure designed to keep 2-300,000 Insurance agents on the phone selling! wow!  and right now, most of them are at home working, so most of the expense of operating all those offices, is now gone, labor, for many business is the single biggest expense, now all the agents working at home still get paid their hourly/bonus, and any allowable benefits, a 401K etc, but infrastructure costs for the Insurance Companies, are almost gone, the agents receive a new laptop, so everybody is on the same page technology-wise, some companies provide a 500 or 1000 dollar \"home office set up check\" the agents have to purchase their own high speed internet, at 70 to 120 dollar a month, electricity to keep a home office running 8-10 hours a day, and now, the \"work from home\" agents are carrying a good part of the cost of Insurance sales, them selves. It\\'s no wonder Company Profits have doubled ,there are not twice as many clients signing up for new Insurance, that\\'s for sure.  As an agent, in the virus/economic crisis we live in, i can give one piece of advice, try not to change your policy this year, in these very unstable uncertain times, keep what coverage you have if it\\'s working for you, if you make one misstep, like  \"oh i forgot to call them back!\" you could find yourself with no Insurance coverage, until the next open enrollment, next year.  Generally, \"I forgot\", is not going to get you a Special Enrollment Period. Moving to another location/state, your company closed and cancelled your policy, your Doctor wont take the policy any more, any thing like that,  that is out of your control, can get you a Special Enrollment Period. So play it safe, be smart, stay the course you\\'re on if possible, this mess is just in phase one, wait if your can, until next fall, 2021,  to rock your own boat, things might be calmed down by then, stay healthy. Most likely because they kept collecting premiums every paycheck, but people were not going to the doctor or having procedures done. Ah yes an for profit Healthcare system. I\\'m sure those higher ups in insurance are happy about the covid cases and can\\'t wait to sell vaccines/care. Wow, it\\'s almost like the same people telling you not to wear a mask make money when you get sick. i am sure they are disappointed in only \"doubling\" their profits....its like they expected more and now will raise rates. JFC - only in America And yet no one is getting ANY care unless you are testing positive. Hard as FUCK to get an appointment before waiting a full month to get in and that was before the virus even hit.. now my doc has denied me an appointment several times and demands now that any and all appointments must be done on a cell phone WITH face to face video...I dont even own a cellphone. Where is the healthcare? it ain\\'t in rural IL outside Chicago, that\\'s for damn sure. Nah nah nah man, the real REAL evil was Obama care, this is exactly what our representatives wanted, and since we elect them, they\\'re a reflection of what we, the people want, right???\\n\\nUpside down loophole logic of a country. JFC - only in America We need a president that would take every penny of profit these scum has reaped from the citizens of the United States and use it to fund accessible healthcare for all Lmfao. Just received a fucking $300 bill for my “free” COVID-19 test. Fuck America! Insurance companies are NOT THERE TO HELP YOU they are there to make money from you, period One thing to keep in mind regarding this, is that at this time, all elective procedures were cancelled. Same-day surgery centers closed. Hospitals were only performing necessary/emergency procedures. So clinics were closed as well. \\n\\nSo people that were able to keep working, were  still paying their premiums. Let them consolidate some more till they just become president of the US. *Cigna,* the First Company to become president. Good things are coming! Thanks, big companies! No shit, no one was going to to hospital for elective procedures. For profit healthcare is obscene. For a long time, I had trouble understanding why the pandemic turned into a political thing. I think I get it now.\\n\\nCorporate profits above all else.\\n\\n🤦\\u200d♂️ I\\'d believe it. US insurance companies are some of the shittiest companies out there. My wife was 2 days early for her optometrist appointment and her insurance refused to pay. While it wasn\\'t a huge amount, $50 instead of $10. It is bull that they refused to pay because she was 2 days early. \\n  \\nThankfully the optometrist wrote it off, but that is pretty shitty. We can expect our premiums going down any time now... /s This blows my mind, how does everyone tolerate this.\\nI went to the ER 5 times last year and the only money i spent was on the vending machine. Free care, free medicine from a doctor, free stitches, free antibiotic iv.\\n Its just so infuriating to hear about your system.\\nAustralia is okay Truly, capitalism is a completely rational system and the only way humans can live. To question it in any way is madness. Yet I can’t afford healthcare because I can’t afford several hundred dollars a month. So I’m fucked if I get seriously sick or hurt. Its almost as if not having a free public option for healthcare can leave people to spend more money on the fewer companies that own the entire pharmaceutical business.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure if the Monopoly rules actually applied the vast majority of the 1% would sue, for example, if you need glasses, not only its almost 100% of it owned by one guy but he is also the one involved in all the optometrist colleges and courses.\\n\\nThat\\'s why we should tax the rich, a world were if the richest person donate 1% of his monthly earnings to a single individual that individual life would change completely is not a fair one. It\\'s not *in spite of* the pandemic, it is *because of* the pandemic. If only there was some politicians that wanted to shut these evil businesses down. Oh well, guess I\\'ll die. Meanwhile, I got laid off during the pandemic by one of the largest health insurance companies in the country. They don\\'t care about you, they only care about the stakeholders and the shareholders.\\n\\nDuring the announcement, they had the audacity to say, they couldnt wait any longer because of the pandemic and that we should understand because this is business. 7 billion dollars paid for medical care that ended up instead going into the pockets of stockholders.\\n \\nAll while hospitals are unable to provide basic protections for workers.\\n \\n\\nBut let\\'s not make this political, lets send them our thoughts and prayers instead. All insurance is a scam for this reason/logic here.  Record profits 20 years in a row - then BAM the 100 year storm hits, suddenly, \"We just can\\'t pay\" and all of the insured are screwed, the CEOs walk away with their hundreds of millions in compensation for the previous years, and go start another one when they get bored of Epstein\\'s island whores.\\n\\nSame bullshit with the financial industry and their tendency to \"make tons of moooooney\" until their pile of debt is unpayable and they go to the government for a bailout.  Absolutely criminal.  \"OOPs\" they say as they collect their billions in bonuses across the industry.  All insurance money, period, needs to be stored in a trust with 50 years worth of \"oops\" money.  At this point it\\'s just clear that all insurance/finance \"industry\" should just be state-run and the benefits should be made available to the people, since the people are ultimately the ones who will bail out the magic money making machines when they collapse, and the people are the ones that pay to keep the status quos regarding global finance, sometimes with their blood in these useless wars, but always with their productivity. calling it profit when its healthcare is the most american thing i have ever heard Widespread moratoriums on elective surgery, and a severe drop in office visits meant that the insurance companies didn\\'t have to pay a lot of their usual expenses during that time. Furthermore, a lot of COVID care was backstopped by the government. Capitalizing on the sick and poor should be on americas flag. land of the rich, home of the corporate slave And yet my insurance company just changed my coverage for a medication I’ve been on for years so that I can only refill it at a specific pharmacy (that I don’t have around me) and only in 3 month supplies. \\n\\nWhich is horribly inconvenient for me because a) there are none of that pharmacy chain near me, b) I have two other medications that I still need refilled from my nearby pharmacy, and c) a three month supply is going to cost me more each time I get my prescription\\n\\nAll because the insurance company wants to cut costs (according to the phone representative I spoke to regarding this) We need Medicare for All now! This immoral system needs to be destroyed, root and stem. It is the cancer that’s killing America, it is truly one of the worst things America has ever devised for its own people. How do they know it\\'s the second quarter tho Oh good!  This means they\\'ll be dropping prices!\\n\\n/s The fact that claims are down and profits are up is a good thing, not a bad thing. It is beneficial for both the policyholder and the insurer to never put in a claim. The policyholder doesn’t want to get injured/sick, and the insurer doesn’t want to pay. It’s a win-win.\\n\\nI agree that costs and premiums are too high, but that is only because the government is distorting the market, trying to help some people at the expense of everybody. Get the government out and we will se higher quality with lower cost, as we do with any other product in the country where the government is not involved. Can you imagine if the US just one day went like, \"oh the rest of the world might not be so stupid after all. Free healthcare sounds like it works pretty well everywhere.\" and then implements it and watches these companies just topple completely?\\n\\nThen the big pharma companies, who rely on insurance companies, but now have to answer directly to the main healthcare provider, the state,  also start losing massive profits.\\n\\nAnd then like, everyone wins, except them?\\n\\nAnd people stop dying because they can\\'t afford insulin?\\n\\nYeah, me neither. Oh good I’m glad somebody has benefited from the pandemic other than grocery chains Wait until premiums get hiked next year lol The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) requires health insurers to refund profits in excess of legally mandated maximums. The article explains this half way down:\\n\\n>But under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, profits are capped.  \\n>  \\n>For each dollar the insurer collects from small businesses and individuals on premiums, it must spend at least 80 cents on healthcare. For premiums from larger employers, the minimum is 85 cents. The remainder can be kept as profit and spent on administration.  \\n>  \\n>Insurers who cross the limit must spend the excess on rebates to consumers within three years. Some insurers have already started sending the checks. Meanwhile, health insurers in the Netherlands are hit by Corona virus and are operating on a loss because of compensations paid to health professionals. Registered Nurse here. I am still shocked by the way These insurance companies have twisted the US Health care system into a useless pile of garbage. \\nYou would think working at big hospital would get you better insurance. Not the case at all! It honestly makes me want to leave the US. I love this country, but how are we supposed to fix this? This is an example of why we need Medicare for all/single payer and get rid of Mafiacare.\\n\\n300,000 projected dead...with thousands dead from scared to go to the hospital.\\nWe have a broken system, while they profit. Meanwhile...I was rejected from a private insurance plan for having depression and literally no other health problems. They came right out and said it was the reason. Wouldn\\'t want my mental health to cut into their profits, after all...\\n\\n\\nFuck American health insurance companies. If the revolution ever comes the people sitting at the top of those empires should be dragged through the streets. Private healthcare insurance is immoral and it should be abolished in America. It’s one thing for people to pool their money so that they can afford services when they are needed, but nobody should be allowed to skim profit off of funds that are meant for people’s healthcare, and they damn sure shouldn’t have a profit motive to deny care. $200 to get my blood drawn to test my epilepsy med levels. My neurologist won’t talk to me until this $200 is paid. I’m going to have this shit the rest of my life. Alright, let’s burn it down. Who’s with me? Fuck health insurance companies. NO ONE \\'likes their insurance provider\\'. These cancerous dipshit companies are only good for siphoning money to undeserving CEOs who honestly are dirty criminals.\\n\\nNUKE THEM ALL FROM ORBIT AND LETS DO SINGLE PAYER. This year, i invested in the ultra-triple-platinum health care plan. I planned carefully for potential injuries or illnesses (jackpot with the covid, amirite). I examined my plans for the coming year and decided that my Gold health package wasn\\'t going to suit my health needs. For only $400 *more* a month I\\'m now covered in case anything should happen. \\n\\nNothing has happened to me yet, though I *really* hope i get sick before the new billing cycle (งツ)ว \\n\\nGonna take a fkn limo to the hospital and stay in the penthouse suite When German health insurers make too much profit, they have to lower their fees. Part of this is due to elective surgeries, routine care, and “regular visits”  being delayed. So in some cases there is pent-up demand that will eat into future profits once people aren’t afraid to receive health care services. \\n\\nSuppose your care plan called for you to get a colonoscopy. What’s the chance you’ve had one since the end of March? 10%? 20%? Doubled profits, or doubled profit margins?\\n\\nI’d fully expect more people to buy health insurance during this time. Doubling profits makes sense. Doubling profit margins would be scummy as fuck. Thew Affordable Care Act requires that 80-85% of insurance revenue is spent on health care. If they profit more than that, they have to send it back to the insured as a refund. I\\'m sure they\\'ve got plenty of creative accountants trying to cook the books (and they\\'re setting up corporate retreats to the Bahamas as fast as they can get private jets reserved) but they can\\'t just keep all that money.\\n\\nEdit: This is one of the *real* reasons the Republicans want to overturn ObamaCare. Considering how Obamacare directly tied our healthcare to our employment this is a fucking feat with 30 million people collecting unemployment right now. I called my car insurance provider told them I wanted a discount because I\\'m literally not going anywhere with my car and haven\\'t been for months. The representative told me he doesn\\'t see any options that can help me. Wtf? If you ever wonder why MC4A will never happen, refer yourself to this article It\\'s all a rich man\\'s game, folks. No surprise. Went for a covid test that they said was free.\\n\\nGet a bill from the lab work at $100. Then one for just the results at $215 because sticking a stick to scratch your brain was on the house.\\n\\nF U healthcare system And yet, I still can\\'t get coverage for proper mental health treatment. A lot of you didn’t read the article and it shows Well yeah. My video chat for the Dr to tell me they wouldn\\'t test me for covid after direct contact with a positive case cost me $150. My er trip with insurance last year cost me $2.5k. They\\'re raking it in and not offering very much help right now. Health insurance in the US is an example of complete ignorance and shows that every single politician cares more about the kick backs than anything else, regardless of side and what \"beliefs\" they campaign on because no ones going to the hospital. I\\'ve had my pitchfork and a torch ready for years, just waiting for you fucks to nut up and give the word. Insurance is one of the greatest scams in modern capitalism. The others being big banking.and big pharma. I\\'m guessing... so did Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu? How the f do we stop these greedy health insurance companies though? The fact that health insurance can get profits makes me ill It\\'s almost like they are \"for profit\" business... If you bought shares in these companies would you get a shareholder discount? Capitalism ONLY benefit the rich. They\\'re fucking criminals For a country full of people who only care about their own wellbeing, they care an awful lot about others profits and losses. Fucking criminal while americans suffer and history will remember Yes. And that is only because no one was going to doctor or having elective procedures. Completely temporary. Fuck our health care system or lack of it.  My daughter used to get echiograms annually for her heart murmur for the copay or 30 dollars.  I got a bill for it this year for 730 bucks... fuck this system This is so simple. Insurers have to hold duration matched assets against their outstanding liabilities. Insurance companies have those assets in the market. Look at the market between 3/31 and 6/30 and you’ll see massive gains. Also, the market didn’t do well in 2q19, so they are “doubling” a relatively poor quarter. No doubt that these companies lost major money in Q1 2020 and that’s why it is omitted from the article. This increase is because of reduction in unnecessary and elective procedures. With rising unemployment, deteriorating mental health, and possible post-covid health problems profits would fall. Not only is it worse, it costs way more\\n\\nYou guys can keep your for profit healthcare What did they think would happen when you force people to buy health insurance Competition benefits the consumer, so inevitably competition in any industry eventually gets bought out until it\\'s down to just a handful of players.  A walk down the shampoo aisle you\\'ll see Dove, Axe, St Ive\\'s, Level 2000, Pond\\'s, Pear\\'s, TRESemmé, V05, Suave...Yeah look at all those options!  It\\'s all Unilever, baby.  But wait, what about Aussie, Head&Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Vidal Sassoon, Ivory, Old spice etc?  Don\\'t worry, they\\'re all owned by P&G.\\n\\nYou wonder why they\\'re able to charge $5.99 for a bottle of Dove body wash now?  Not hard when you and another company own the entire aisle together.  And yet there\\'s that innocuous bottle of Power Stick body wash sitting there on the bottom shelf for $1.00.  It\\'s reviewed well everywhere, but we\\'ve been trained by the large companies that items of low cost surely *must* be inferior.\\n\\nThere\\'s no way around it, the constant acquisitions are toxic for consumers, and they know it. Just wait till next year you know dam well our premiums will sky rocketed due to the “rising cost of medicine” last 5 years at my work it’s been a 7% increase per year I’m betting it’s going to be a 30% next year I work at a drs office and insurance only gave us 1/3 of what we billed. Wanna know why prices are so high? Bc insurance hardly pays doctors anything so prices have to keep raising. The insurance industry is Satan in corporate form. I\\'m sure they\\'ll  lower their premiums next year then\\n\\n/S Insurers are actually the problem with US healthcare. I worked in healthcare finance for a few years. Pharma companies are not the problem like a lot of people think. Some bad apples like everything else, of course, but health insurers bring in ridiculous money. Compare the revenue of the largest hospital corporation in the country to the largest health insurer. cray cray Health insurers doubled in profits while American citizens quadrupled in debt.. American healthcare is such a joke. Only in this country can a corporation profit from a pandemic... This is so wrong Meanwhile our massive health system is on a salary freeze for all front line workers... wonder where this money is going... This is sickening. Literally. As long as these insurers are allowed to do as they please, affordable healthcare will become less and less accessible to the average person, and the country will become not just poorer, but sicker. Its pitiful and disgusting how this country got so corrupt and ass backwards. Of course it takes a global pandemic for most of these horrifying things to come to light. I doubt anything will be done, there are so many laws and loopholes designed to help only the richest and most powerful.\\n\\nThis country is fucking depressing I\\'ll be sure to steer all my \\'hospitals are in a conspiracy pushing COVID19\" friends over to insurance companies now. They\\'ll really appreciate that. Sadly, not kidding...they will be all over this like stink on shit. My insurance company is fighting with me on renewing an asthma inhaler I’ve been on for 16 years. They want me on something “cheaper”. Fuck you Blue Cross. Insurance companies should be non profit. I’m not endorsing the current system, but when you have people still paying their premiums while you are in lockdown and can’t actually do anything to be claimed this is what happens. There\\'s some misinformation here. Health insurance companies doubled profits due to lack of use in hospitals. People were not going to their physicians for check ups, they weren\\'t getting those elective surgeries, nothing.\\n\\nHowever, it does not mean these services will just disappear. It just means demand is going to be pent up. Once people start to feel comfortable with going to hospitals they will be going and getting these services done.\\n\\nHealth insurers are waiting for this to happen, and most would be very unwise to view the doubled profits as actual profits. They are just holding the cash until the market corrects and they are forced to pay it all out to physicians and hospitals for the backed up services.\\n\\nThis is very different from say, car insurance, where they\\'ve passed these profits back to customers. They know they won\\'t be using the funds because cars aren\\'t going to be any more likely to get into accidents and submit claims. If course they did. It’s the new oil. So much is fundamentally wrong in the US, but of coarse dumbified and brainwashed Americans defend their shit country  with downvoting!\\n\\nAnd with millions infected and over 150000 deaths you could argue that \"health insurance\" shouldn\\'t make a profit.\\n\\nThe total and complete failure of \"US capitalism\" I was playing golf with an insurer trying to complain about how hard it was to right a policy. I Rolodex him and by the 16th hole he stopped talking. Chump, he’s insuring people and literally doesn’t know what he’s talking about. This is a two pronged problem honestly. Medical billing will charge you crazy rates if you use insurance. But if you pay cash, the price goes down dramatically. In this case though, the insurance companies are the worst. I don\\'t get it, insurance should do benefit when there is no problem and loose money when everyone starts using it.\\n\\nAnd here, they are making way more when we are using it and they are supposed to help and pay.\\n\\nI probably missed something. I\\'ll have to dig Slowly but surely people are starting to see the real reason behind this pandemic. In other news, triangles are triangular. Meh.  They just got a positive shock to the system.  People will get angry with them, but their anger is misplaced.  State laws make many of these insurers much less competitive than they would otherwise be, which is why auto-insurance offered a slight discount and these people didn\\'t need to.  \\n\\nEven with that being the case, it\\'s not like health insurance companies are making money any faster than any other company.  They\\'re returns on investment are about the same as other companies on the SP500. Of course money is up! Sick and dying people is big business! The more sick, the more money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What could be better for business than covid! The more covid the more the ownership class makes!!! \\n\\n\\nGreat system you got there, America.\\n\\n Jesus fucking christ. The company I work for has turned plenty of profit in this quarter,  yet has denied lots of its workers a raise this year. They deliberately changed my pay cap to be less than it was last year so I wasn’t able to get a raise. \\n\\nYes, I know I’m lucky to be employed currently, but what good is that income if it doesn’t keep up with cost of living? Insurance is a scam, if you haven\\'t figured it out by now you maybe never will, insurance companies only care about making money, they DONT want to do anything for you and will look for any reason possible to deny paying out on claims, they wright all sorts of little clauses into their contracts that make it easier for them to deny your claim, they want nothing but to take money from you while supplying as little as possible in return, they are evil greedy trash that should be shut down. Do you realize if you just saved all the money you pay those companies you could handle the emergencies on your own without their \"help\" id be surprised if they have ever actually done anything to help anyone. This is amazing how well educated and collaborative everyone is regarding the wrongs of health insurance agencies. So how do medical professionals come together, including the public to overrule these companies? I\\'m a physical therapy student and this is a hot topic. Many therapists I know go to legislative meetings and stand in front of legislators showing the statistics we serve in dropping health care costs with wellness, non-invasive and no pharmaceutical involved treatments. \\n\\nLawyers, legislators, government bodies, health organizations how do we strategically fight this epidemic? Holy shit America get your shit together.'"

You shouldn't kill someone, but if someone is trying to blow up a building, killing them is probably a necessity. These are examples on the extreme, but even lesser situations allow for certain actions what would normally be frowned upon or cause a shunning to happen without negative consequences. I don't know what you're going through, so I can't tell you what to do. Even if I did know your situation completely, I could advise you, but I couldn't control your actions the same way you couldn't control mine.
