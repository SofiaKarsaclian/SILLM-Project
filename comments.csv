gl4zny,abortion,Group buys Alabama abortion clinic to keep it from closing," 

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey last year signed into law legislation that would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony punishable by up to 99 years or life in prison for the abortion provider.

A federal judge blocked the Alabama law from taking effect while a challenge plays out in court.

International attention on the Alabama ban prompted an outpouring of donations as celebrities shared information on their social media accounts about the group and the fight in Alabama.

‚ÄúIt was like a deluge. It was literally like a deluge of grassroots donations,‚Äù Reyes said.

Gloria Gray, who has owned the clinic since 1993, said in a statement issued through Yellowhammer that she was looking to retire but had been concerned about keeping the clinic doors open.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting years, holding out until I could sell my interest in the company without affecting the clinic, without preventing women from being able to get abortions in Alabama,‚Äù Gray said.

Yellowhammer did not disclose the purchase price.

There are three clinics in Alabama that perform abortions. West Alabama, with its proximity to Mississippi, is the busiest. The clinic in 2017 performed about half of all abortions in the state, according to statistics from the Alabama Department of Public Health.

Reyes said it is particularly important to keep the Tuscaloosa clinic open in ‚Äúa region that is particularly abortion-hostile.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe stars just aligned in a kind of way where we had the resources at the right time. Now we are going to be able to more robustly fulfill our mission,‚Äù Reyes said.",5

Circumstances allow for all sort or behavior to be allowed without repercussions. You shouldn't hit an animal, but if that animal is attacking someone, you do whatever you can to stop it. You shouldn't kill someone, but if someone is trying to blow up a building, killing them is probably a necessity. These are examples on the extreme, but even lesser situations allow for certain actions what would normally be frowned upon or cause a shunning to happen without negative consequences. I don't know what you're going through, so I can't tell you what to do. Even if I did know your situation completely, I could advise you, but I couldn't control your actions the same way you couldn't control mine.

inznpg,climate change,Los Angeles records county's highest temperature ever on record,"Wait... \*checks notes\*

**Yup. The record highest temperature for anywhere on Earth with a humid\* climate has been tied, potentially having been reliably recorded only once before.**

Here are the previous potential instances:

July 6, 1936: Steele, North Dakota

* Climate type according to the K√∂ppen system: Warm-summer humid continental (*Dfb*)
* Note: While not enough to exclude it from consideration entirely, the fact that the *next* hottest temperature recorded at the station was 110 ¬∞F in May 1948 makes this incredibly unlikely even with such a significant heat wave as happened in 1936, and such a temperature is probably due to overexposure.

July 18, 1936: Fredonia, Kansas

* K√∂ppen climate type: Humid subtropical *(Cfa)*
* Note: Like with Steele (though less so), the nature of this area's climate makes such a reading questionable.

July 24, 1936: Alton, Kansas

* K√∂ppen climate type: Hot-summer humid continental *(Dfa)*, bordering Humid subtropical *(Cfa)*
* Note: Some meteorologists, including extreme temperatures researcher Maximiliano Herrera, consider this to be dubious and likely a result of overexposure.

August 7, 1981: Red Bluff, California

* K√∂ppen climate type: Hot-summer/subtropical mediterranean (Csa)
* Notes: As far as I can ascertain, this is undisputed.

**September 6, 2020: Woodland Hills, California**

* K√∂ppen climate type: Hot-summer/subtropical mediterranean (Csa)
* Notes: Unless this area was in the direct windfall of a nearby wildfire, I don't see a reason to dismiss this reading.

If you're wondering why the list seems to be US-centric, it's not intentional‚Äîafter thoroughly searching, there legitimately seem to be no humid climate locations outside the US that have ever got to 121 ¬∞F, not even, say, the savannahs of tropical West Africa and grishmic monsoonal forests of the northwest Indian subcontinent.

\*That is, a climate where the average integrated precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration, synonymous to a climate that is neither arid nor semi-arid.",56

Doubling profit as a raw number is one thing, but their margins remain relatively stable.  The only way for them to increase their margins is to decrease their administrative costs.

(They are also required to share back to all plan members any premium revenue less than .85 of every $1.00 spent.  E.g.  If a plan only spends .80c of every premium dollar on services for a given year, they split the .05c margin of revenue between all the plan members and send them a check.

These companies have ZERO incentive to try to make your care better, cheaper, or easier.

Edit: because it's not even 9am and I'm all fired up already, if anyone ever wonders about this... Take a look at every ""change"" the insurance industry has pushed and see how it negatively impacts patients...

-adding new drug formulary tiers to plans, causing patients to pay more in drug co-pays and making branded drugs less available. 

-adding more prior authorizations or step edits to drugs they may have to pay slightly more for. Have a drug that will knock out a disease in two weeks but it'll cost them $75... Nope, first you have to use a cheaper chronic daily generic and even if you get slightly better they won't cover the two week drug because ""you showed improvement"" on the one they don't pay as much for. 

-offering employers high deductible plans for the employees. Employers take them because they are cheaper (for the company, not for you). Insurers know most patients with high deductible plans will put off care because of the massive out of pocket costs. Except there are boatloads of studies that show this leads to WORSE outcomes for patients (who miss important diseases because they're putting off care). But why should insurers give a shit, they're just banking premiums and paying less out.",6

And you don‚Äôt even need to trust our good will. If our MLR (a calculation for how much money we spent on healthcare costs) is below 80% to 85%, we have to pay back rebates to reach that amount (for ACA plans only though).

We are on a different time schedule than most P&C companies like car insurance. They generally sell on a 6 month basis and we sell 12 month. Plus we have a ton more regulations. All this means we are slower to pay you back.

i9jrvl,healthcare,US health insurers doubled profits in second quarter amid pandemic,"Abolish health insurance. They have always been unethical.  All those things they tell you Universal Health Care will do: death panels, delays in treatment, exorbitant cost, etc; they already do those things. 

Death Panels: They don't officially decide on cases. Instead, the the healthcare provider contacts them to find out if something is covered by your policy and then the insurance company decides if the treatment is something they have to pay for based on your policy. If they don't want to pay for it, that's fine. You still get the treatment right? But now you owe $5,000-$500,000 depending on the treatment out of pocket. This leads to the United States' most common cause of bankruptcy: medical debt. 

Delays in treatment: Hospitals and private practices get to pick which insurance companies they work with and accept. This means not every doctor will be able to accept your insurance, and if you like a certain doctor or need a treatment from a specialist, you'd better hope they are ""in network"". If not, you're spending time searching for a doctor and possibly having to travel far to get the doctor that accepts your insurance. Often, health insurance companies have a lot of customers in one area. Most people get health insurance through their employers, whom generally work with health insurance companies they've seen providing to other local companies in their area. Since there are a lot of people on the same coverage within one area, you're more likely to have to use the same doctors for treatment, which causes delays as they have to schedule you in.  Unless you're going to the emergency room, you likely have to wait weeks or months to get to see a doctor if you believe something is wrong with you. With UHC, you'd be able to pick any doctor you like, which barring a lack of choice for doctors in your area, should spread around and have shorter waiting periods.

[Exorbitant cost](https://www.daveabels.com/broken-bones-can-result-in-thousands-of-dollars-in-losses/#:~:text=If%20you%20suffer%20a%20broken,responsible%20for%20copayments%20and%20coinsurance.): Insurance companies use the model of being a middle man. They literally take money from you monthly (unless you're lucky enough that your employer pays all premiums), then act as a barrier for you receiving treatment without their permission. Because Healthcare Providers have to work with them, they have gotten to set prices for non-insured patients as a deterrent for not having insurance.  This is why a bag of Saline, which costs $2-5 to manufacture, costs between $60-250 to have administered. Perhaps you break your leg and you don't have insurance.  Good news! You get to owe the hospital $17,000-$35,000! Sure, you could say some of that is labor.  But in reality, it's price fixing between the insurance company and the hospital. The best part is that if the insurance *does* cover your treatment, they get to pay significantly less than you would have to. Typically barely above manufacturing costs, and almost always less than half of what you would have had to pay out of pocket.

i9jrvl,healthcare,US health insurers doubled profits in second quarter amid pandemic,"This is terribly misleading from a forward-looking POV. 

Many in the comments have noted that P&C insurers are issuing refunds... health insurers will do the same; the refund calcs and regulations are not being reflected solely in Q2 earnings reports. It will come later as refunds are due to be paid to customers, employers, etc.

In addition, I'll note that many insurers are re-deploying these profits in the form of a VARIETY of member benefits. Almost anyone insured by one of the big health insurers (Aetna, Cigna, Anthem, Humana, United) should have received a care pack... usually masks, sanitizer, etc. 

The companies are also offering other benefits to at-risk populations among their books. This includes items like meal delivery, programs to help combat the increased risk of adverse outcomes from social isolation, etc. Again, those offsetting costs won't show up specifically in Q2 expenses, so quoting a 3-month window at the start of the pandemic BEFORE insurers could get these response measures launched is terribly misleading to generate a headline.

Finally, I would challenge those on the provider/physician side using this as an opportunity to share their anecdote about the evil insurer not letting them practice. Just in the COVID space alone, insurers are already seeing a significant level of abuse in the COVID coding rules... which makes a ton of sense when you learn that COVID admissions have a 20% reimbursement premium mandated by the Cares Act.

That person would do so much business as everyone in the US started moving to them and away from the other businesses in insurance, that insurance companies would either be forced to lower their prices, increase their value, or would go out of business.

So in regards to THIS story they may have reported double profits in Q2 but they can keep that up or they will be fined.
And said fine will probably eat up most or all of the profit made in future quarters.

i9jrvl,healthcare,US health insurers doubled profits in second quarter amid pandemic,"There is a LOT of misinformation in this thread.

Preface: I despise the current US health care model, and in no way want to be seen as a defender of it.

But, if the insurance companies make too much money, they'll have to pay back the extra anyway. One of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act was mandatory minimums on their Medical Loss Ratio. In other words the ratio of their income that must go to paying claims. For individual and small group plans, it's 80%. For large group sales, it's 85%.

If they aren't paying out claims, and their ratio drops below these, they are legally bound to issue rebates.

However, the process for doing so is also heavily regulated. I believe it is accessed annually (although I don't remember if it's the same date for all plans or based on what quarter the plan started or something). Point is, they can't just issue rebates whenever they want or it'll screw up their rate reviews with the government.

At the end of the day, they won't get to make gobs of money off of this. Not for long. 

Although if you really want to get into ""how the sausage is made"", they'll profit it in other ways. Insurance companies have to keep a regulated amount of ""cash on hand"" to pay out claims. Much like a bank cannot lend out 100% of their money at once. In the meantime they can invest those funds and earn profits from those investments. IIRC, those profits are not part of the MLR calculations, so they will make money from the excess income, then pay back the rebates later as needed.",4
i9jrvl,healthcare,US health insurers doubled profits in second quarter amid pandemic,"I work for a nonprofit insurance company in Wisconsin. Couple reasons we‚Äôre turning a profit -

* Many providers stopped providing elective surgeries and treatments during the pandemic. Many have restarted, but these are cash cows for hospitals and major costs for insurance companies. 

* People, overall, are going out less. Telehealth appointments are becoming far more common and  a lot of hospitals charge a flat price for these - $20-40 per appointment compared to a traditional visit, which costs more. 

* Fewer people are reaching out for care. Part of it is fear of getting sick but also fear of cost. Layoffs have also had an impact as many are seeing cut and reduced coverage. 

* And finally, fewer people are hitting their deductibles. Usually, the profit margins begin to slide the closer you get to the end of the year - and this is important, because if this fall is as bad as they say it could be, those profits the media is telling you to get upset about may be what guarantees payment and coverage if you or a family member ends up in the ICU on a ventilator. I won‚Äôt justify a $6000 deductible for an individual - that is horseshit. But that is still better than the full, $20k bill. 

And because my company is nonprofit, we are mailing out premium rebates and our employee premiums were covered for a couple months. I‚Äôm just hoping we didn‚Äôt overspend now because this area is poor and people are fucking stupid, spreading shit like, ‚ÄúBIlL gAtEs iS gOiNG To mIcrOChIp uS WitH tHE vACcInE!‚Äù all while making $12 an hour, doing repetitive tasks in a factory, day after day.

[Also there's a grassroots group called ""Black Guns Matter""](https://blackgunsmatter.myshopify.com/). It goes around city to city teaching urban minorities about proper firearm usage/safety and their right to bear arms. The founder of that group also points out that gun control is in fact racist, at least the gun control currently pushed by groups right now is. Before you say ""no it isnt"" lets go over the fact of modern gun control proposals. 

1.  Every single one of them increases the cost of ownership, IE in some way, taxes, fees, etc it makes gun ownership cost more. Joe Biden's assault weapons ban basically means ""if you're poor and want an AR-15 get fucked nerd"".

2. Minorities being poorer means it makes gun ownership harder for minorities. Using the logic of disparate impact this means gun control policies, due to their outcomes, are in fact racist.

Also funnily enough the kind of gun control proposed by Biden, IE increasing the cost of ownership, was the same kind of gun control regulation used after the civil war to disarm recently freed slaves.....it's actually pretty fucking hilarious the democrats are pushing the same policies they did from that era. In that era they simply made the only legal guns the ones that so happened to be the most expensive guns.....because freed slaves couldn't afford them. The also made open carry illegal so freed black men couldnt defend themselves from the lynch mob.


EDIT: Fun fact on gun laws in america: gun control laws don't apply to some one who can basically afford to incorporate, get a FFL that allows them to purchase post-sample machine guns(aka the real military gear), and then they can have literally what ever they want. Write the whole operation off as a loss on their taxes just so they can own automatic firearms. I promise you some very rich people discretely do this. For example co-founder of microsoft Paul Gardner Allen owns a tank, so when someone says ""you can't own a tank"" yes you can, if you're rich enough and politically connected enough.

Edit: By ""no government after Reagan"", I'm not praising Reagan. Reagan's CA government passed gun regs with bi-partisan support. No government after that has given that power back even though everyone today knows and bitches about how racist it was. I could have phrased that better.",229

I am a white conservative and to my core I celebrate the sight of black and brown people exercising their 2A right. To me, the 2A represents a manifestation of personal responsibility and self determination. Everyone should reject the notion that it is somehow humane to force the outsourcing of self-protection to a potentially disinterested agent of the state.  And those who take it upon themselves, at a core level to provide for their own protection, are more likely to recognize that other fundimental self interests, are too best vested in their own hands.

The right to self defense is innate within any person, because they only get one chance is this universe. That time is not to be cut short, nor are the right of a people to be squandered.

Just look at how they handled the Ammon Bundy takeover of federal land. They waited back and didn't order a siege to take him down. 

Same with right wing protesters with guns, cops aren't coming out and tear gassing those crowds because they know pushing too hard can result in deaths. 

The left needs to arm themselves just like the right. Even if you don't see a day of conflict breaking out at the very least you can better defend yourself and your home instead of hoping police can do their job. Added bonus at any protest with a large open carry contingent will make police think twice about confronting the group with excessive force.

However, what I like and what I dislike about guns doesn't really matter if it's a peaceful protest. They have this right, and they should exercise it if they feel they must. So long as it isn't being used as a mask for hate groups or as a way to downplay actual gun violence, there's nothing wrong with it and they have my support.

Common sense gun control doesn't mean taking guns away from minorities or white people or anyone. Nor does it mean these types of walks would be disallowed. This is their right, that can not be taken away.",2

A more level playing field is a much better environment to be heard from than unarmed vs police in riot gear with many weapons.  


This is our country and our 2nd amendment right. This country is about us, not about policing or making any damn thing easy or safe for police. I dont give a damn if police feel unsafe or out gunned.

There are literally too many to count just from the last decade.

The 2A may act as a buffer against the authority of the state, but Americans should not forget the frequency with which those guns are turned on fellow citizens. Americans have had a fuck load of guns forever, but the history of armed Americans successfully resisting their government is essentially non-existent. 

I know I'll probably be downvoted to oblivion, and if so, fine. It speaks to the problem that Americans think they either have to be 100% against guns, or accept this wild west system where anything less than complete unregulated access to firearms is considered an infringement on human rights.",2

The uneducated legislators always do.",2
hc211l,gun control,Black gun owners plan pro-Second Amendment walk,"I see a ton of redditors claiming that being pro gun is only socially acceptable when minorities decide to arm themselves. Just wanted to share some insight for anyone feeling this way.

It's all about the message that armed protestors are trying to send and how they go about doing it, regardless of race.

When a bunch of armed white protestors choose to rally or protest, it's historically been for not-so-good reasons (e.g. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/philadelphia-armed-white-men-george-floyd-protests).

People wouldn't care if armed white protestors are protesting to raise awareness about climate change or saving puppies. People care and socially condemn armed white protestors who try to intimidate others and use guns to oppress other people's first amendment rights.

The reason why minorities arming themselves is gaining national support socially is all because of context. Black lives are lost everyday due to police brutality, hate crimes, and THEIR RIGHT TO EXERCISE THE 2ND AMENDMENT. What happened to Philando Castile and the silence from the NRA shows the government's stance on black gun ownership.

Police feel more threatened by unarmed black children than they do by armed white men. That's the problem and that's why gun ownership by minorities is now socially acceptable.",2

hc211l,gun control,Black gun owners plan pro-Second Amendment walk,"I love this. Black Americans own less than 1% of the guns in this country, we need to bump those numbers up.

I was in my lock gun store this week picking up some parts and there were at least 5 black men in there getting guns (store is limited to 20 people at the moment). It‚Äôs in a rural mostly white area, and normally there may be one black person in there. 

Considering the racist history of gun control, I‚Äôm glad to see the number of black gun owners increasing.",2

Gun rights are: 

Women's rights

Black rights

Gay rights

Trans rights

(your identity here) Rights


Minorities, especially black, are over 10x more likely to use a legally owned firearm in self defense than a white person . 

Women use legally owned firearms to stop a sexual assault ~800,000-2,000,000 times a year in the US. 


I support anyone and everyone who chooses to exercise their rights safely; a right not exercised is a right lost. The 2nd Amendment is the bulwark the guards the rest of the Bill of Rights, the founders thought it so important that it was very nearly the 1st Amendment.",5
