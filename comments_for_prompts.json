It goes around city to city teaching urban minorities about proper firearm usage/safety and their right to bear arms. The founder of that group also points out that gun control is in fact racist, at least the gun control currently pushed by groups right now is. Before you say \"no it isnt\" lets go over the fact of modern gun control proposals. \n\n1.  Every single one of them increases the cost of ownership, IE in some way, taxes, fees, etc it makes gun ownership cost more. Joe Biden's assault weapons ban basically means \"if you're poor and want an AR-15 get fucked nerd\".\n\n2. Minorities being poorer means it makes gun ownership harder for minorities. Using the logic of disparate impact this means gun control policies, due to their outcomes, are in fact racist.\n\nAlso funnily enough the kind of gun control proposed by Biden, IE increasing the cost of ownership, was the same kind of gun control regulation used after the civil war to disarm recently freed slaves.....it's actually pretty fucking hilarious the democrats are pushing the same policies they did from that era. In that era they simply made the only legal guns the ones that so happened to be the most expensive guns.....because freed slaves couldn't afford them. The also made open carry illegal so freed black men couldnt defend themselves from the lynch mob.\n\n\nEDIT: Fun fact on gun laws in america: gun control laws don't apply to some one who can basically afford to incorporate, get a FFL that allows them to purchase post-sample machine guns(aka the real military gear), and then they can have literally what ever they want. Write the whole operation off as a loss on their taxes just so they can own automatic firearms. I promise you some very rich people discretely do this. For example co-founder of microsoft Paul Gardner Allen owns a tank, so when someone says \"you can't own a tank\" yes you can, if you're rich enough and politically connected enough.

Point is, they can't just issue rebates whenever they want or it'll screw up their rate reviews with the government.\n\nAt the end of the day, they won't get to make gobs of money off of this. Not for long. \n\nAlthough if you really want to get into \"how the sausage is made\", they'll profit it in other ways.

        "Comment 65: 'I work for a nonprofit insurance company in Wisconsin. Couple reasons we\u2019re turning a profit -\n\n* Many providers stopped providing elective surgeries and treatments during the pandemic. Many have restarted, but these are cash cows for hospitals and major costs for insurance companies. \n\n* People, overall, are going out less. Telehealth appointments are becoming far more common and  a lot of hospitals charge a flat price for these - $20-40 per appointment compared to a traditional visit, which costs more. \n\n* Fewer people are reaching out for care. Part of it is fear of getting sick but also fear of cost. Layoffs have also had an impact as many are seeing cut and reduced coverage. \n\n* And finally, fewer people are hitting their deductibles. Usually, the profit margins begin to slide the closer you get to the end of the year - and this is important, because if this fall is as bad as they say it could be, those profits the media is telling you to get upset about may be what guarantees payment and coverage if you or a family member ends up in the ICU on a ventilator. I won\u2019t justify a $6000 deductible for an individual - that is horseshit. But that is still better than the full, $20k bill. \n\nAnd because my company is nonprofit, we are mailing out premium rebates and our employee premiums were covered for a couple months. I\u2019m just hoping we didn\u2019t overspend now because this area is poor and people are fucking stupid, spreading shit like, \u201cBIlL gAtEs iS gOiNG To mIcrOChIp uS WitH tHE vACcInE!\u201d all while making $12 an hour, doing repetitive tasks in a factory, day after day. \n\nYeah... that makes you more qualified than an actual doctor or virologist who has spent years in their field.'

Everyone deserves to be taken care of. Yes, the federal stimulus checks being distributed aren't enough. By all means, be pissed that our legislators aren't taking better care of us. But undocumented people are part of our communities here in CA, and deserve help, too. To my fellow Californians who are wigging out about this: you probably know an undocumented person (or a person in a mixed status family) and not realize it. These are our neighbors. Like citizens and residents, they're struggling to make ends meet and/or are risking their health working shit jobs because they're considered essential during the pandemic.

There are alot of undocumented workers that live here and that's the reality. Either we let them starve and deal with the consequences of that or we treat them like human beings and give them the aid they need to keep their communities from being ripped apart.\n\nThis is not a time for bitchy selfish behaviour.
